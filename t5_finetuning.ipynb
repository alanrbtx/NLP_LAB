Основатель, генеральный директор и главный инженер компании SpaceX; инвестор, генеральный директор и архитектор продукта компании Tesla; основатель The Boring Company; соучредитель Neuralink и OpenAI; владелец Twitter. 7 января 2021 года, с состоянием по оценочным данным в 185 млрд $, впервые стал богатейшим человеком планеты, сместив на второе место основателя Amazon Джеффа Безоса[6]. 1 ноября 2021 года стал первым человеком в истории, чьё состояние достигло отметки в 300 млрд $[4][⇨]. Маск родился и вырос в Претории, ЮАР. Некоторое время учился в Преторийском университете, а в 17 лет переехал в Канаду. Поступил в Университет Куинс в Кингстоне и через два года перевёлся в Пенсильванский университет, где получил степень бакалавра по экономике и физике. В 1995 году переехал в Калифорнию, чтобы учиться в Стэнфордском университете, но вместо этого решил заняться бизнесом и вместе со своим братом Кимбалом  (англ.)рус. стал соучредителем компании Zip2, занимавшейся разработкой программного обеспечения для интернета. В 1999 году компания была приобретена Compaq за 307 миллионов долларов. В том же году Маск стал соучредителем онлайн-банка X.com, который в 2000 году конгломеративным путем консолидировался с Confinity и образовал PayPal. В 2002 году компания была куплена eBay за 1,5 миллиарда долларов. '\n",

Основатель, генеральный директор и главный инженер компании SpaceX; инвестор, генеральный директор и архитектор продукта компании Tesla; основатель The Boring Company; соучредитель Neuralink и OpenAI; владелец Twitter. 7 января 2021 года, с состоянием по оценочным данным в 185 млрд $, впервые стал богатейшим человеком планеты, сместив на второе место основателя Amazon Джеффа Безоса[6]. 1 ноября 2021 года стал первым человеком в истории, чьё состояние достигло отметки в 300 млрд $[4][⇨]. Маск родился и вырос в Претории, ЮАР. Некоторое время учился в Преторийском университете, а в 17 лет переехал в Канаду. Поступил в Университет Куинс в Кингстоне и через два года перевёлся в Пенсильванский университет, где получил степень бакалавра по экономике и физике. В 1995 году переехал в Калифорнию, чтобы учиться в Стэнфордском университете, но вместо этого решил заняться бизнесом и вместе со своим братом Кимбалом  (англ.)рус. стал соучредителем компании Zip2, занимавшейся разработкой программного обеспечения для интернета. В 1999 году компания была приобретена Compaq за 307 миллионов долларов. В том же году Маск стал соучредителем онлайн-банка X.com, который в 2000 году конгломеративным путем консолидировался с Confinity и образовал PayPal. В 2002 году компания была куплена eBay за 1,5 миллиарда долларов. '\n",
